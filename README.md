Hi, I'm actually trying to develop my first website with a training of Udemy. I've been told that I have to commit every day. So here are the files ! <br>
As you'll see in the files, there's french text <br>
Every helplful advice will surely be appreciated ! <br>
I probably have to optimize my code to make it more readable, so let me know what could be changed for more lisibility :D <br> <br>
